Depression comes in three kinds. The first is called normal depression,
and it is the type each of us knows well. It springs from the pain and
loss that are inevitable parts of being members of a sapient species,
creatures who think about the future.

The two other kinds of depression are called depressive disorders:
unipolar and bipolar despression. What determines the difference of 
them is whether or not mania is involved. Mania is psychological 
condition with a set of symptoms that look like the opposite of
despression: unwarranted euphoria grandiosity, frenetic talk and action,
and inflated self-esteem.

Bipolar depression always involves manic episodes; it is also called
manic-depression (with mania as one pole and depression as the other).
Unipolar depressives never have manic episodes. Another differnece 
between the two is that bipolar depression is much more heritable. If
one of the two identical twins has bipolar depression, there is a 72
percent chance the other also has it. Unlike normal and unipolar 
depression, manic-depression is an illness, appropriately viewed as a
disorder of the body and treated medically.

Both normal depression and unipolar depression involve the same four
types of negative change: in thought, mood, behavior, and physical
responses.
